# Kirby PWA

Turns your project into a PWA (progressive web app) for Kirby 3.

## What is PWA (Progressive web app)?

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in combination with progressive enhancement to give users an experience on par with native
apps.

PWAs provide a number of advantages to users â€” including being installable, progressively enhanced, responsively designed, re-engageable, linkable, discoverable, network independent, and secure.

PWAs need at least three icons: a favicon for the browser page, a device icon for the for the installed application, and an icon used on the splash screen of the installed application.
